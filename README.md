These are the design files for a word clock
(see http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Word_Clock). It's based on 
a 200x200 mm² PCB which is meant to be built into a small 23x23 cm² 
RIBBA picture frame from IKEA.

The single layer PCB is based on the schematic from mikrocontroller.net 
(variant 1) with small changes to the pin assignment in order to
simplify the layout. The software was modified according to these
changes.

Included is a laser cutting template for the (german) front plate and
light grid.
