        <h1>Overview</h1>

<p>These are the design files for a word clock (see
<a href="http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Word_Clock">mikrocontroller.net</a>). It
uses a 20x20 cm² single layer PCB which is meant to be built into a small
23x23 cm² RIBBA picture frame from IKEA.</p>

<h1>PCB</h1>

<p>The single layer PCB was created using <a href="http://www.geda-project.org">gEDA</a>
(gschem and pcb). It's based on the schematic from mikrocontroller.net (variant
1) with small changes to the pin assignment in order to simplify the layout.
Because the PCB has only a single layer, it can be produced at a low cost. I
ordered mine from <a href="http://platinenbelichter.de">platinenbelichter.de</a> for less
than 30 EUR.</p>

<h1>Parts</h1>

<h2>LEDs</h2>

<p>You need 97 LEDs (through hole, not SMD). I bought a pack of 100 straw hat leds
from eBay.</p>

<h2>LED Series Resistors</h2>

<p>Depending on the lengths of the words on the front panel, there are groups of
one, two, three, or four LEDs for each word. Each group needs one series
resistor whose value depends on the number of LEDs in the group, the supply
voltage, the LED current, and the LED forward voltage. In my case, the voltage
across each group is 10.6 V (12 V wall power supply minus 1.4 V voltage drop
across the MIC2981 driver). For my LEDs, I simply experimented with different
resistor values for 1,2,3,4 LEDs in series until the current matched 20 mA.</p>

<h2>Complete Part List</h2>

<p>See part-list.ods for a complete part list.  In Germany, you can order all
parts from <a href="http://www.buerklin.com">Bürklin</a>,
<a href="http://www.reichelt.de">Reichelt</a> and eBay---see list for part numbers.</p>

<h1>Firmware</h1>

<p>The original software from mikrocontroller.net was modified to comply with the
schematic and pcb layout changes but was not altered otherwise.</p>

<h1>Letter Stencil</h1>

<p>The word clock requires a letter stencil in front of the LEDs. A laser cutting
template for a german version of the stencil is included.  I used 1.5mm thick
MDF (bought from <a href="http://www.gerstaecker.de">Gerstaecker</a>). Note: Painting MDF
requires many passes with intermediate sanding! Be patient.</p>

<h1>Light Guide</h1>

<p>The LEDs must not light up neighboring letters. Therefore, we need some kind of
guide to block their light. The files for a laser cut paper light guide are
included. Depending on the thickness of the material you might have to
regenerate the template from the source SVG.
I used black paper for my laser cut light guide.</p>
