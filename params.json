{"name":"Small RIBBA Word Clock","tagline":"Design files for a word clock based on a single layer 20x20 cm² PCB for use in a small RIBBA picture frame from IKEA.","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\nThese are the design files for a word clock (see\r\n[mikrocontroller.net](http://www.mikrocontroller.net/articles/Word_Clock)). It\r\nuses a 20x20 cm² single layer PCB which is meant to be built into a small\r\n23x23 cm² RIBBA picture frame from IKEA.\r\n\r\n# PCB\r\n\r\nThe single layer PCB was created using [gEDA](http://www.geda-project.org)\r\n(gschem and pcb). It's based on the schematic from mikrocontroller.net (variant\r\n1) with small changes to the pin assignment in order to simplify the layout.\r\nBecause the PCB has only a single layer, it can be produced at a low cost. I\r\nordered mine from [platinenbelichter.de](http://platinenbelichter.de) for less\r\nthan 30 EUR.\r\n\r\n# Parts\r\n\r\n## LEDs\r\n\r\nYou need 97 LEDs (through hole, not SMD). I bought a pack of 100 straw hat leds\r\nfrom eBay.\r\n\r\n## LED Series Resistors\r\n\r\nDepending on the lengths of the words on the front panel, there are groups of\r\none, two, three, or four LEDs for each word. Each group needs one series\r\nresistor whose value depends on the number of LEDs in the group, the supply\r\nvoltage, the LED current, and the LED forward voltage. In my case, the voltage\r\nacross each group is 10.6 V (12 V wall power supply minus 1.4 V voltage drop\r\nacross the MIC2981 driver). For my LEDs, I simply experimented with different\r\nresistor values for 1,2,3,4 LEDs in series until the current matched 20 mA.\r\n\r\n## Complete Part List\r\n\r\nSee part-list.ods for a complete part list.  In Germany, you can order all\r\nparts from [Bürklin](http://www.buerklin.com),\r\n[Reichelt](http://www.reichelt.de) and eBay---see list for part numbers.\r\n\r\n# Firmware\r\n\r\nThe original software from mikrocontroller.net was modified to comply with the\r\nschematic and pcb layout changes but was not altered otherwise.\r\n\r\n# Letter Stencil\r\n\r\nThe word clock requires a letter stencil in front of the LEDs. A laser cutting\r\ntemplate for a german version of the stencil is included.  I used 1.5mm thick\r\nMDF (bought from [Gerstaecker](http://www.gerstaecker.de)). Note: Painting MDF\r\nrequires many passes with intermediate sanding! Be patient.\r\n\r\n# Light Guide\r\n\r\nThe LEDs must not light up neighboring letters. Therefore, we need some kind of\r\nguide to block their light. The files for a laser cut paper light guide are\r\nincluded. Depending on the thickness of the material you might have to\r\nregenerate the template from the source SVG.\r\nI used black paper for my laser cut light guide.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
